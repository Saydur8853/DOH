# This Python script prepares a benign-only dataset for DNS traffic analysis:

# It reads two CSV files: chrome.csv and firefox.csv, both containing benign (non-malicious) DNS traffic data.

# It combines the data from both files into a single dataset using pandas.

# A new column called label is added, where all entries are assigned the value 1 to indicate that they are benign.

# The combined and labeled dataset is saved as a new CSV file named ssl_zero_day_benign.csv.

# A confirmation message is printed once the process is complete.

# This dataset can be used for training machine learning models to differentiate between benign and malicious traffic.
